# footswitch4sculan

Here is a very simple Sketch for ATmega32U4-based Arduino Boards which let
use a footswitch with the Yaesu ScuLan Network Remote Control System.

It actually provides an USB keyboard which simulates pressing the SPACE bar key.

Just connect the footswitch betweend GND and pin 3 on the Arduino Board.
